    <p>Rocky Balboa is a 2006 American sports drama film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is
        the sequel to Rocky V (1990) and the sixth installment in the Rocky film series. It also stars Burt Young and
        Antonio Tarver. In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone), now an aging small restaurant owner, is challenged to an
        exhibition fight by hothead young boxer Mason Dixon (Tarver).

        Development for a sixth Rocky film began after Stallone expressed regret of the outcome of Rocky V, which was
        viewed as a disappointing conclusion to the end of the franchise. Rocky Balboa includes references to characters
        and objects from previous installments, and Stallone was inspired by recent personal struggles and triumphs when
        writing the film.[2] It is Stallone's first directorial effort since Rocky IV (1985) and is Tarver's only
        feature film appearance. Principal photography began in December 2005 and lasted until January 2006, with
        filming locations including Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. In contrast to previous entries in the
        franchise, the fight choreography in Rocky Balboa was less scripted, featuring real punches thrown by Stallone
        and Tarver.</p>
