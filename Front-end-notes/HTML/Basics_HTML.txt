HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
-Its a markup Language
-We don't implement complex logics here.
-Just markup a plain text onto a webpage.


-HTML Elements
<p> element represents a paragraph of text
<i> elements represents Italic text.
<h1> element repressents the main header on a page
<img> element embeds an image
<form> element represents a form

--------------------------------
<p> element
<p>I am a paragraph</p>
--------------------------------

<h> element
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6>

Example:

<h1>Beetles</h1>
    <h2>External morphology</h2>
        <h3>Head</h3>
            <h4>Mouthparts</h4>
        <h3>Thorax</h3>
            <h4>Prothorax</h4>
            <h4>Pterothorax</h4>

Output:

Beetles
    External 
    morphology
        Head
            Mouthparts
        Thorax
            Prothorax
            Pterothorax

Notes: 
The font size of each heading is default h1 to h6. large to small
Good practice is to maintain a single h1 tag

----------------------------------
Inspect tool
-We can inspect the entire webpage with this option
-Just right click on any webpage and select Inspect
-In the inspect page on top left we see an option to select an item to inspect.
-Select that and select any section of the webpage, the corresponding code is highlighted in the inspect section.
-We can edit that and see the changes affected onto the webpage
-Since it is being modified in the local machine, upon refreshing, the webpage gets back to its normal state.

HTML Skeleton Explained

<!DOCTYPE html> // The DOCTYPE must be present. It informs the browser that this is an HTML document.
-DOCTYPE is a flag so it does not need a closing tag.

<html lang="en">

</html>         // An html start tag and an html end tag define the start and end of an HTML document.
-Also known as root element
-Permitted content:	One <head> element, followed by one <body> element.
-Tag omission:	    The start tag may be omitted if the first thing inside the <html> element is not a comment.
                    The end tag may be omitted if the <html> element is not immediately followed by a comment.
