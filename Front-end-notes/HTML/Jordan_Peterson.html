        (born 12 June 1962) is a Canadian psychologist, author, and media commentator.[5][6] He began to receive
        widespread attention in the late 2010s for his views on cultural and political issues, often described as
        conservative.[7][8][9] Peterson has described himself as a classic British liberal[10][11][12] and a
        traditionalist.[13]

        <p>
            Born and raised in Alberta, Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from
            the
            University of Alberta and a Ph.D. in clinical
            psychology from McGill University. After researching and teaching
            at Harvard University, he returned to Canada in 1998 and became a professor of psychology at the University
            of
            Toronto. In 1999, he published his first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, which became the
            basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book combined psychology, mythology, religion, literature,
            philosophy and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and meaning.

        <p>
            In 2016, Peterson released a series of YouTube videos criticizing the Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights
            Act
            and the Criminal Code (Bill C-16), passed by the Parliament of Canada to introduce "gender identity and
            expression" as prohibited grounds for discrimination.[b] Peterson claimed that the bill would make the use
            of
            certain gender pronouns, "compelled speech", and related this argument to a general critique of political
            correctness and identity politics. He received significant media coverage, attracting both support and
            criticism.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2018, he paused both his clinical practice and teaching duties and published his second book: 12 Rules
            for
            Life: An Antidote to Chaos. Promoted with a world tour, it became a bestseller in several countries.
            Throughout
            2019 and 2020, Peterson suffered health problems in the aftermath of severe benzodiazepine withdrawal
            syndrome.
            In 2021, he published his third book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, resigned from the University of
            Toronto, and returned to podcasting. In 2022, Peterson signed a content distribution deal with the
            conservative
            media company The Daily Wire and became Chancellor of Ralston College. His various lectures and
            conversations,
            propagated mainly through YouTube and podcasts, have gathered millions of views.

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
            Peterson was born on 12 June 1962, in Edmonton, Alberta,[14] and grew up in Fairview, a small town in the
            northwest of the province.[15] He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson.
            Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school
            teacher.[16][17] His middle name is Bernt (/ˈbɛərənt/, BAIR-ənt),[18] after his Norwegian
            great-grandfather.[19]
            Peterson grew up in a mildly Christian household.[20]
        </p>

        <p>
            In junior high school, Peterson became friends with Rachel Notley and her family. Notley became leader of
            the
            Alberta New Democratic Party and the 17th premier of Alberta.[21] Peterson was a member of the New
            Democratic
            Party (NDP) from ages 13 to 18.[22][23] As a teenager, Peterson decided that "religion was for the ignorant,
            weak and superstitious" and hoped for a left-wing revolution, a hope that lasted until he met left-wing
            activists in college.[20]
        </p>

        <p>
            As a young man, Peterson became obsessed with the Cold War and the possibility of a nuclear apocalypse.[24]
        </p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered Grande Prairie Regional College to
            study
            political science and English literature,[25] studying to be a corporate lawyer.[3] During this time he read
            The
            Road to Wigan Pier by George Orwell, which significantly affected his educational focus and
            worldview.[25][3] He
            later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his BA in political science in 1982.[22]
            Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe, where he began studying the psychological origins of the
            Cold
            War; 20th-century European totalitarianism;[25][10] and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche,
            Aleksandr
            Solzhenitsyn,[16] and Fyodor Dostoevsky.[10]

            Peterson then returned to the University of Alberta and received a BA in psychology in 1984.[26] In 1985, he
            moved to Montreal to attend McGill University where he earned his PhD in clinical psychology under the
            supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital
            until
            June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier.[25][27]

            While at McGill University and the Douglas Hospital, Peterson conducted research into familial alcoholism
            and
            its associated psychopathologies, such as childhood and adolescent aggression and hyperactive
            behaviour.[28][29][30]
        </p>

        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>
            From July 1993 to June 1998,[31] Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting
            research at Harvard University, where he was hired as an assistant professor in the psychology department,
            later
            becoming an associate professor. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and
            alcohol
            abuse.[28] An article in The Harvard Crimson said he possessed a "willingness to take on any research
            project,
            no matter how unconventional".[22] While at Harvard, he switched his primary area of research from familial
            alcoholism to personality and authored several academic papers.[32][33][34][35][36][37] Author Gregg
            Hurwitz, a
            former student of Peterson's at Harvard, has cited Peterson as an inspiration of his, and psychologist
            Shelley
            Carson, former PhD student and now-professor at Harvard, recalled that Peterson's lectures had "something
            akin
            to a cult following", stating, "I remember students crying on the last day of class because they wouldn't
            get to
            hear him anymore."[4] Following his associate position at Harvard, Peterson returned to Canada in 1998 to
            become
            a full professor at the University of Toronto.[26][31][9]
